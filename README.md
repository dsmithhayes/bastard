# Bastard

Bastard is a very small framework that forked the [Slim Skeleton application](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton) and made it useful for building applications that need an HTML view layer. [The Plates templating engine](https://platesphp.com/) was selected to do these renderings. This is a pet project and not meant to be used by anybody but me.
